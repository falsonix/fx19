All files can be printed with a standard FDM machine in their current orientations. If you encounter the issue of the keycaps not fitting onto your switches due to tolerances, please scale them up by 1%.

####### NOTE #######
The diffuser should be printed with a light colored filament for maximum effect from the lights.
